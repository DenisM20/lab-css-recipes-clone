    <h4>Directions</h4></n>
    <p>1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. 
      Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce 
    temperature and let simmer.</p>
    <p>2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. 
      Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so 
      that it does not run off.</p>
    <p>3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
      Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft</p>
